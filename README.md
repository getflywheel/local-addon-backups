# Local Cloud Backups Add-on

A [Local](https://localwp.com/) add on for backing up sites to a personal storage platform. This repository hosts the source code; if you simply want to use the add-on, download the latest version of local from [the release page](https://localwp.com/releases/) and install the add-on within the app.

This add-on leverages [`restic`](https://restic.net/) and [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/) to manage backup snapshots on a variety of storage platforms.

### Get Started with Local Add-on development

https://build.localwp.com/


## Manual Installation & Development setup

*If you haven't already, it is advised that you familiarize yourself with the basics of [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).*

### Git LFS

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used in this repository to manage large binary files (restic and rclone binaries).

#### Installation

1. `brew update`
2. `brew install git-lfs`
3. `git lfs install`

**Important Note!** After installing LFS, run `git lfs pull` in `local-addon-backups` to ensure that all of the LFS binaries are properly pulled.


### Clone

Clone the repository into one of the following directories depending on your platform:

-   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Local/addons`
-   Windows: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Local\addons`
-   Linux: `~/.config/Local/addons`

*You need to replace 'Local' with 'Local Beta' in the above paths if you want to create the add-on for Local Beta.*

If you prefer to clone your source code elsewhere, you can do so and then symlink that directory to one in the above mentioned directories.

An example of this on MacOS would look like:

```
git clone git@github.com:getflywheel/local-addon-backups.git ~/code

ln -s ~/code/local-addon-backups ~/Library/Application Support/Local/addons
```


### Install Add-on Dependencies

`yarn install`


### Build

This add-on utilizes `tsc` to compile the add-on.

`yarn build`


### Add Add-on to Local

1. Clone repo directly into the add-ons folder (paths described above)
2. `yarn install` or `npm install` (install dependencies)
2. `yarn build` or `npm run build`
3. Open Local and enable add-on

If the enabling the add-on via the Local UI doesn't work for some reason, you can also enable it by updating the file `enabled-addons.json`. This is located at one of the following application specific paths.

You'll want to make sure that the json file includes:

`"@getflywheel/local-addon-backups": true`

-	macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Local/enabled-addons.json`
-   Linux: `~/.config/Local/enabled-addons.json`
-   Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Local\addons/enabled-addons.json`

### External Libraries

- @getflywheel/local provides type definitions for Local's Add-on API.
	- Node Module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getflywheel/local-components
	- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/getflywheel/local-components

It is worth noting the the TS definitions for this module are exposed and publicly availble. The actual code is injected once the add-on is loaded by Local. This can make writing tests a little tricky as the `@getflywheel/local/<main/renderer>` module isn't available outside of Local (ie testing unit testing environments). The best option is to mock out this module while running tests.

- @getflywheel/local-components provides reusable React components to use in your Local add-on.

### Folder Structure

All files (other than test files) in `/src` will be transpiled to `/lib` using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Anything in `/lib` will be overwritten.

`vendor` contains compiled binaries namespaced under the appropriate operating system name. We only include 64 bit builds for OSX & Linux. Both 64 and 32 bit builds are included for Windows.

* [Restic binary builds](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases)
* [Rclone binary builds](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/releases)
